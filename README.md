**Comparative Study of Search Algorithms for Travel Planning**

This repository contains the implementation of various search algorithms based on the research paper "A Comparative Study on Informed and Uninformed Search for Intelligent Travel Planning in Borneo Island." The study compares the performance of different search algorithms in solving the shortest path problem within a travel planning context.

**Algorithms Implemented**
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Random-Walk
Hill-Climbing Search
Best-First Search
A* Search
Custom Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Features**
Comprehensive implementation of both informed and uninformed search algorithms.
Practical example of travel planning using a sample graph.
Detailed comparison of algorithms in terms of pathfinding efficiency.
